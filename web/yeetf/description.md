_it's pronounced "yee-tee-eff"_

A script kiddie I know wanted to make his own CTF, so he tried to setup CTFd with his own challenges. It looks like he
tried to copy and paste a trivia question he found online for the first challenge, but it didn't work - it just shows up
as garbage in the description.

Can you find a way to get the flag without even knowing the question?!

**Note: To avoid spam, emails from CTFd for this challenge will only be delivered email addresses on
